# Bash Project - Combining Text Files

# This is a simple script to concatenate text files. This useful tool helps organize multiple text files into a single, consolidated text file. It operates by sequentially reading each specified input text file in the given order and appending its contents to the end of the target text file. By handling this repetitive task automatically, the script saves time and eliminates the potential for manual copy-paste errors, making sure to ensure an accurate combination of textual data.
